# UnrealCSX

This is a WIP hobby project to bring an RE Engine style virtual machine to Unreal Engine to help migrate Unity developers to Unreal. 

The reasoning behind this. If you are coming from Unity and do not have much knowledge od C++ and Bluerptins feels alien to you, then the engine itself can feel inaccessible.

Whilst other C# integrations exist, they rely on mono which is not fully cross platform on some consoles
