# UnrealMono
WIP - Mono Running in Unreal Engine doing AOT

# Project Objectives
1. Integrate C# with Unreal Engine
Objective: Enable scripting in C# as an alternative to Blueprints for Unreal Engine.
Goal: Make it easier for Unity developers to migrate to Unreal Engine by providing a familiar scripting environment.

2. Use Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation
Objective: Support AOT compilation for platforms where Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is not allowed or practical.
Goal: Ensure compatibility with platforms such as iOS and other environments requiring AOT.

3. Embed Mono Runtime
Objective: Integrate the Mono runtime into Unreal Engine to support managed C# code execution.
Goal: Allow C# assemblies to be executed within Unreal Engine without the need for engine recompilation.

4. Implement P/Invoke for Unreal API Calls
Objective: Facilitate communication between managed C# code and Unreal Engineâ€™s C++ API.
Goal: Enable C# scripts to call Unreal Engine functions and interact with Unreal Engine objects using Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke).

5. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility
Objective: Provide a cross-platform solution compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android).
Goal: Guarantee that C# scripting and AOT compilation work seamlessly across different platforms supported by Unreal Engine.

6. Provide Clear Documentation and Examples
Objective: Offer comprehensive documentation and practical examples for users to get started with C# in Unreal Engine.
Goal: Make it easy for developers to integrate, use, and troubleshoot the C# scripting environment.

7. Maintain Performance and Reliability
Objective: Ensure that the integration maintains high performance and reliability across different platforms.
Goal: Optimize the runtime environment and AOT compilation to meet the performance standards of Unreal Engine.
