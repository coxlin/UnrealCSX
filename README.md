# UnrealMono
WIP - Mono Running in Unreal Engine doing AOT

# Project Objectives
1. Integrate C# with Unreal Engine -  Enable scripting in C# as an alternative to Blueprints for Unreal Engine. Making it easier for Unity developers to migrate to Unreal Engine by providing a familiar scripting environment.

2. Embed Mono Runtime - Integrate the Mono runtime into Unreal Engine to support managed C# code execution.

4. Implement P/Invoke for Unreal API Calls - Enable C# scripts to call Unreal Engine functions and interact with Unreal Engine objects using Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke).

5. Ensure Cross-Platform Compatibility - povide a cross-platform solution compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android) via AOT

6. Plugin Based - Ensure that the integration is a plugin and does not require full engine source
